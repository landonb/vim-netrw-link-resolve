INTRODUCTION                                    *netrw-link-resolve*

After a file is opened via `netrw`, e.g., using `:Explore`, this plugin
closes the opened file if if was opened from a symlink path, and reopens
the file using its real path.

This avoids a problem that occurs if you open the same file using
two different paths, as Vim will treat the buffers independently
and will not let you save changes without a bang, e.g., `:w!`,
and scolds you otherwise:
>
  E13: File exists (add ! to override)
<
COMMANDS                                        *netrw-link-resolve-commands*

None. Uses the `g:Netrw_funcref` callback to run.
